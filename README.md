# Memory Game Project

## Instructions

The aim of the game is to match all the cards. 
You should match a total of 8 pairs to win the game!

Once you click on a card, it will turn face up.

You will get a star rating, based on the numbers of moves you make to complete the game.

Try your best and have fun!

## Dependencies 

We were given the HTML and CSS by Udacity. 
I made some minor changes to the code to create a modal.

I watched a lot of youtube videos and also found a lot of useful tips from;
[Matthew Cranford](https://matthewcranford.com/memory-game-walkthrough-part-1-setup/) and [Sandra Israel-Ovirih](https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-build-a-memory-matching-game-in-javascript).
